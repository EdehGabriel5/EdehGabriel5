👋 Hi, Edeh Gabriel, a Full-Stack Developer with hands on experience in creating and deployment of school management information system, multi vendors events management system etc. I am a graduate of Computer science and statistics with second class upper from the university of Nigeria Nsukka. I currently work as a Software Engineer at Occsions SoftTech Limited.

👀 I’m interested in using data for good by building front-end and back-end projects that meet the daily needs of users.

🌱 I’m currently learning C# and Redux and taking part in the 100 Days of Python Challenge💪.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open source projects, network with like-minds and ultimately form meaningful friendships.
